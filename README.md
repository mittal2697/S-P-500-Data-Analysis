# S-P-500-Data-Analysis

Data analysis and visualization of sp500 index using python.

The most well-known financial benchmark in the world is the Standard and Poor's 500, or S&P 500. This stock market index monitors the performance of 500 significant businesses that are listed on American stock exchanges. As terms of finance and investing are broad, we are focusing on exploring equity markets (US stock market) for average retail investors (small investors that usually don't have any impact on market price). This is accomplished by manipulating the data from the S&P 500 and viewing the results of the exercise in form of visualizations.

Nowadays, it's crucial to manage your finances or invest your money in a way that will help you be ready to combat inflation. Because if your money is not invested appropriately, inflation will reduce the value of your hard-earned dollars. The stock market is thus one option for investing your money. However, stock market investing calls for in-depth market understanding as well as the capital necessary to turn a profit. As of 2022, there are roughly 138 big stock exchanges around the world(List of Stock Markets, 2022). We chose to analyze the Standards & Poor's 500 market index. The S&P 500 is a market index that tracks the progress of the top 500 performers across a range of industries. In this project, we'll look at a variety of tactics that a novice retail investor might employ to succeed in the stock market.


######## This Project Explores Below Guiding Questions ################

1.> How S&P 500 is structured, what are the components, and how is the final price calculated? What sectors and industries are there? Who are the leaders in each one of them?
The US Stock market is like a huge supermarket with many departments and goods. This question will help us to navigate and eventually construct our basket.

2.> How random are markets? Are there fat tails? How the distribution of market returns compares to the normal distribution?
We will confirm that market returns does follow normal distribution and can use this as a risk management tool, i.e. volatility targeting.

3.> Are there any seasonal patterns in the stock market?
We will prove or disprove such well-known seasonalities as the Santa Claus Rally, Sell in May And Go Away, etc.

4.> Are there any momentum effects? Does past performance determine future ones?
Momentum is a well-known phenomenon in the stock market. Simply put, what goes up will continue going up and vice versa or the winners keep winning.

######## Why this is important? ############

These questions will be important in observing the behaviour of S&P 500 stock market index in market over the years and will help us identify seasonalities in the market if any, randomness in the market, momentum effects etc.

This will help us define tactics that a novice retail investor might be able to exploit to book some profits in the market without the substantial capital or using all the prediction algorithms that this big investing firm uses.


This Project uses daily updated datasets of S&P 500 sourced from kaggle. Since the length of the datasets is too large to upload to the git I'm attaching the link to the datasets below. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks?resource=download

Or you can use the below api call for the same,

kaggle datasets download -d andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks

Once you have all the datasets just run all the cells in the python notebook.
